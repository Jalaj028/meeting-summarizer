Meeting Date: January 15, 2024
Attendees: John Smith (Product Manager), Sarah Johnson (Engineering Lead), Mike Chen (Designer), Lisa Wang (QA Lead)

John Smith: Good morning everyone. Let's start with our sprint planning meeting. We have three main items on the agenda today: the new user dashboard feature, bug fixes from last sprint, and planning for the upcoming product launch.

Sarah Johnson: Thanks John. From the engineering side, we've completed 80% of the dashboard backend. The API endpoints are ready and tested. We're just finishing up the data aggregation service. Should be done by Wednesday.

Mike Chen: The design mockups for the dashboard are finalized. I've uploaded them to Figma. The team has access. I've also created a prototype showing the user flow. One thing to note - we've simplified the navigation based on user feedback from the beta test.

Lisa Wang: QA has identified 15 bugs from the last sprint. 5 are critical and need immediate attention. They're all related to the payment processing module. I've assigned them to the team already.

John Smith: Good. Sarah, can your team prioritize those critical bugs?

Sarah Johnson: Absolutely. We'll tackle them first thing tomorrow. Should have fixes ready for QA by end of day Tuesday.

John Smith: Perfect. Now about the product launch - marketing wants to go live on February 1st. That gives us two weeks. Are we on track?

Sarah Johnson: The core features are ready. We just need to complete the dashboard and fix these bugs. I'm confident we can meet the deadline.

Mike Chen: I'll need to create some marketing assets - screenshots, feature highlights. I can have those ready by next Monday.

Lisa Wang: We'll need at least 3 days for final regression testing before launch. So everything needs to be code-complete by January 28th.

John Smith: Agreed. Let's set January 28th as our code freeze date. Any blockers or concerns?

Sarah Johnson: We're still waiting on the third-party API documentation for the analytics integration. It's not critical for launch, but it would be nice to have.

John Smith: I'll follow up with the vendor today. Anything else?

Mike Chen: The new color scheme has been approved by brand team. I'll update all the screens this week.

Lisa Wang: No blockers from QA, but we could use one more tester for the launch prep.

John Smith: I'll talk to HR about getting a contractor for two weeks. Okay, let's summarize our action items:
1. Engineering to fix critical bugs by Tuesday
2. Complete dashboard backend by Wednesday
3. Mike to prepare marketing assets by next Monday
4. Code freeze on January 28th
5. John to follow up on API documentation and contractor

Everyone: Sounds good!

John Smith: Great. Let's reconvene on Thursday for a progress check. Thanks everyone!
